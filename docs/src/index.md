# Introduction

A small package allows to index arrays by a function via a simple wrapper `FI`. Besides, for indexing with `!=(n)`, `!in(itr)`, there is another wrapper `not` providing a convenient and optimized way, which is similar to `Not` of [`InvertedIndices.`](https://github.com/JuliaData/InvertedIndices.jl), but faster in some cases.
